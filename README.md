# Calculator
Calculator for solving basic mathematical expressions in postfix notation and converting infix expressions to postfix.

## Introduction
We have 2 methods in our Calculator:
* **evaluatePostFix** : This Method is used to calculate the postfix expression in string format using a stack and it throws error if there is any invalid postfix expression in the input.
* **convertExpression** : This Method is used to covert a given inifix expression into a postfix expression, so, that we can use our calculator to calculate infix expressions too.
